I haven't coded a lot of python scripts but I decided to do some scraping.
This program uses HTTrack and youtube-dl to automagically scrape URLs using 
a file with links to crawl. HTTrack is available here: https://www.httrack.com/

I originally used this program to capture videos and photos from a user's 
timeline but this can be altered in any way you see fit. The HTTrack program
is also free (GPL) Libre/free software. I suppose you could proxy it using Tor
or your own proxies, or just feed it a file of proxies and import threading.
